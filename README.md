# ESP8266 LED Control with Blynk

This project allows you to control an LED using the Blynk app on your smartphone and an ESP8266 microcontroller.

## Components:
- ESP8266 board (NodeMCU or any other ESP8266 variant)
- LED
- Resistor (around 220Î©)
- Jumper wires

## Setup:
1. **Connections:**
   - Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to a GPIO pin on the ESP8266 (e.g., D2).
   - Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to the resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the ESP8266.

2. **Blynk App:**
   - Download the Blynk app on your smartphone (available on both Android and iOS).
   - Create a new Blynk project.
   - Add a Button widget to your project.

3. **Arduino IDE:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Install the ESP8266 board support: `File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs` and add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`.
   - Install the "ESP8266" board using the Boards Manager.
   - Install the Blynk library: `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`, search for "Blynk" and install it.

4. **Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into your Arduino IDE.
   - Replace the values for `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID`, `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME`, and `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` with your Blynk template values.
   - Upload the code to your ESP8266 board.

5. **Run:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the ESP8266's serial output.
   - Power up your ESP8266 board.
   - The LED should turn on or off based on the button state in the Blynk app.

## Troubleshooting:
- If the LED doesn't respond to the button in the app:
  - Check the wiring and ensure the LED is connected to the correct GPIO pin.
  - Verify that the Blynk app is connected to the ESP8266 and the button widget is properly configured.

This README provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the project. Adjust the GPIO pin in the code if needed, and make sure your Blynk app is configured correctly. If issues persist, check the wiring and consult the troubleshooting section.
